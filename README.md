This app was developed on the Hackathon event that was organized by Pošta Slovenije(https://postartup.si/sprint-poste-slovenije-2020/). Our team developed app and CMS for organizations that want to encourage employees to learn about new topics that are important for the company. In our app, we added gamification elements to make learning and usage of our app more interested and fun. 

With this idea, we came in 2nd place. 

Team that participate on this hackathon was:
Klemen Skledar - Design and UX (https://www.linkedin.com/in/klemen-skledar-3639b8166)
